\title{
Species Distribution Model for Presence-Only data
}
\description{
This function fits a Gaussian Markov Random Field for a given species and a given
sample. 
This is part of my thesis.
But in uses a Conditional Autoregressive Model jointly defined as i) The presence-only
data of a given species and ii) The Sample Effort defined by other type of data. 
Assumptions:
Both are Bernoulli observations.
